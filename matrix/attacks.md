# Matrix Attack Targets
## KE District Office
I'm assuming you are talking about a reasonable big office. Going off the Host guide in the book I'm feeling that maybe a rating 8 Host will handle the bulk of the security. It should be on an AresTM grid.
To give you an idea about this Host I'll toss you some dicepools. Everytime you try to do an action there will be a 16D Matrix Perception test taken against you, the Firewall will consist of 11 dice (without a Spider to back that up you are going against a decent sized pool), there will probably be a decent-ish Spider on call who will be ready to unleash some whop-ass on you if you screw up.
Data will be encrypted and littered with Data Bombs (Ranks 3-4 for the most part, maybe a 5 or 6 on something super valuable.) Various fun types of IC will pour out, in particular Probe & Track will be readily available with the nastier stuff in spades. They won't necessarily want to kill you so provided you can get your hack done and get out fast hopefully you won't jack-out to a SWAT teams assault rifle in your face. So if you get caught keep going on the hack until your are done. Messaging your team that company may be arriving is only polite.
The police and detectives will have varying personal defences on their own personal gear expect anywhere from 6-10 dice on the defence.
## Big 10 Manufactory
Here they aren't the police, so the big change is that Black IC will almost definitely be used. If you get caught, don't continue the hack get out as soon as Black IC show and survive. The Host will be on it's respective megas Grid.
One of the biggest defences here could be the raw amount of data that you'd have to search through, with the cameras, doors, pay data, industrial equipment and so on that you are going to have to sift through and deal with.
All of the workers will be using their cheap links and will probably have defensive pools of around 6-8 dice. That's what you want to attack if you want to fiddle with peoples gear.
## Opposing Shadowrun Faction Hangout
The team will probably be using only their links and decker to defend themselves. So expect smaller dicepools than in the previous scenario, on the flip side the team might go silent if the find you knocking about. So any damage you do will have to be subtle such as not to be picked up on.
Alternatively a Decking duel might occur, Decker does something to the team, Rival Decker works out what the problem is and sticks up a jammer and hacks the teams Decker back.
The apartment/warehouse/whatever complex might have a Rating 3 host that both deckers can fiddle with.
## Talismonger's HQ on a Yacht
Spirits omae, spirits. 8-10 dicepool for the defence for their personal gear. The boat itself might have an alright device rating and you'd base everything off of that.
