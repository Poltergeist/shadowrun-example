# Matrix Combat Example
There is one clear first step to a matrix duel...
  - Matrix Perception checks to find eachother (Opposed tests in the case that they are running silent).
  
After that it becomes a little less clear cut. They could
  - Gather Marks, super useful will allow you to do half of the tricks that two deckers would want to do on one another
  - Gather enough marks for a Trace Icon to direct the rest of the team to pick off their opponent in the meat.
  - Hide (This means your opponent has to start back at square 1) however this only works if your opponent has failed to get a mark on you.
  - Grid Hopping, impose some penalties from hacking to another Grid on both users.
  - Full Matrix Defence, higher defence pools for the entire combat round mean that hopefully the duel won't end too quickly.
  - Data Spike, just a painful old hurt the decker.
  - Erasing Marks, to stop the other Decker from pulling tricks on you.
  - Crash Program (Requires 1 Mark) force your rival to stop running one of their programs

Of course they have to remember that GOD could converge on them at anytime during this duel so they don't want it to go on for too long.
## In Practice
D-elite and Hurts got into a fight over how to split the payment from their last data dive, D-elite thinks he should get 65% of the cut because it was his contacts which managed to sell the data. Both have Novatech Navigators.
## ROUND 1
Roll Initiative, Hurts is in Hot Sim VR because cold sim is for chumps whilst D-elite is only in AR at the time (chump). Hurts gets 22 and D-elite gets 11 dice on this round.
Not at all happy with this Hurts searches for D-elites Deck (he did just get cheated out of 15,000 nuyen it was a big big payday). He rolls his matrix perception of 16 dice (Only 12 after doing his work from another Grid and due to noise) against D-elites pool of 10. He narrowly beats D-elite by a single success. D-elite hurt by the words jumps into VR cold-sim planning to do some light pranking on his chummer.
Realising that he's in the wrong Grid to really show D-elite the error of his ways Hurts swaps onto the Emerald City Grid so that his future moves won't be suffering. D-elite unlike his omae Hurts has a Satellite and isn't suffering from the noise at all. Having jumped into cold sim he gets an extra 6 initiative. D-elite does his perception test 14 dice vs. 9 against Hurts and gets enough successes to find out the Hurts has recently swapped onto the Emerald City Grid.
Hurts still has 2 initiative left after these passes and attempts a hack on the fly at D-elite. Throwing a hefty 15 dice against 10 dice and gets the successes necessary to get his first mark. However it was a close thing as D-elite managed to get half of his pool in successes in his defence check. Hurts now has an overwatch score of 5.
## ROUND 2
D-elite rolled perfectly, getting 26 whilst Hurts rolled rather pathetically only achieving a measly 16.
D-elite goes on the full defence seeing his chummer Hurts swap Grids so close after their argument. Hurts tries to get another mark via Hack on the Fly, however this time it's 15 dice vs. 15 dice. Hurts fails the test by one success as D-elite gets an equal amount of success, 4.
Hurts now has an OW of 9.
D-elite is going to get his Agent in on the action and hits hurts with a Hack on the Fly. He now has a monumental 19 dice vs. Hurts's 10, Hurts rolls well, but D-elite gets 2 net successes and finds out his friend attempted to hack him last round. The cheek! D-elite OW 3
Hurts realises that he might have a little trouble beating D-elites top notch security in a prolonged duel and tries once again to get another mark, this time successfully. Hurts OW 13.
D-elite decides that now that things are serious it's time to switch into Hot Sim and really get the party started, he gets another 5 initiative meaning that he still has another two actions.
With these two actions D-elite rapidly picks up a scary 3 Marks... Enough to force Hurts to reboot and suffer dumpshock on his next round!
## ROUND 3
Through the fate or statistics Hurst manages to go first. And with his last action he traces D-elites icon successfully pinning it down to an apartment in Redmond. He quickly sends out a message to a "cleaner" that there is a man inside that needs to be dealt with, he'll pay the cleaner 15,000 nuyen. Hurst OW 15
D-elite then hits Hurts for a shockingly painful Data Spike, link-locking Hurts. Hurts barely manages to soak enough of the 12P heading his way (only soaks 3P)... he's not going to survive the dumpshock if he manages to jack out. Hurts calls for his Street Doc to pay an emergency visit and jacks out... hopefully his Street Doc is speedy as Hurts takes another 2P and falls into overflow... He'll be dead if his doc doesn't make it to his place and stabilise him in 12 short minutes.
## Aftermath
D-elite now plans on keeping the entire funds for himself. He is completely unaware that a man is currently on the way to his place and is planning on killing him for a sweet reward... however that's a problem for another adventure.
