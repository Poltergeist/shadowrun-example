Miss Muffet’s team had just extracted an Ares researcher by the name of A. Tuffet from the Bellevue Ares enclave. Unfortunately the run went south real fast, so she’s racing to a street doc to patch up her chummers, Curds and Whey, who are stable but with full physical damage boxes.
Ares, wanting to get their researcher back but also doesn’t want this incident to become public (because the researcher is known for less than ethical experiments), put a bounty on Miss Muffet and contact a rigger that goes by the name of Spider, who happens to be in the area (one might even say, beside her?). Ares has planted an RFID tag inside A. Tuffet and gave Spider the RFID tag data to track Miss Muffet.
While on Highway 520, Spider sees his chance to catch up to Miss Muffet.
Spider is driving a Honda Spirit. He has put a standard weapon mount packing a Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR on it. He believes in making every shot count. And of course a rigger interface.
Miss Muffet is driving a Ford Americar. She also has a standard weapon mount but believes in the more spray and prey approach and has an Ares Alpha. And of course a rigger interface too.
Both riggers have a 7 to both reaction and logic through some combo of ware and natural talent, all other stats are assumed to be 3. And a 6 to all relevant skills. Both have a rating 2 control rig and smart links in their eyes (either cybereyes or just the smart link implant). Upgraded sensor arrays on their vehicles of 7. And they both plugged in directly to their RCCs, which is the Vulcan Liegelord (data processing of 5, firewall of 6). Both are running in hot sim.
# Setting

## Environment
Our riggers are on Highway 520 cutting through Bellevue to get to the Redmond Barrens. Which is where Miss Muffet’s Street Doc contact lives.
This is a Speed Environment (SR5, 204) which means speed is more important than handling. Right now the threshold for driving is +2 Average (SR5 p199) for dealing with moderate traffic, +0 Open Terrain (SR5 p201) +1 Partial Light (which can be ignored because it can be assumed both our riggers have low light sensors on their vehicles sensor array SR5 p175). So drive tests will be at a threshold of 2.
Distances
Spider starts at a long distance, not wanting to tip off that he’s targeting Miss Muffet.
## Turn 1

## Surprise Test
Along comes Spider that wishes to snipe Miss Muffet’s tire. So he tries to ambush Miss Muffet.
Miss Muffet rolls reaction + intuition, threshold of 3. Which will be 10 dice.
Miss Muffet gets only 2 hits. Normally she’d be taking a -10 to her initiative score (IS) and wouldn’t be able to defend for the first Initiative Pass (IP). Miss Muffet doesn’t want to get her chummers and herself killed so uses a point of edge to reroll the dice that didn't get a hit. She rolls 8 dice and gets 3 hits. She is now sitting at 5, and won’t be surprised.
Spider doesn’t have to roll, but hypothetically if he was waiting for Miss Muffet and didn’t know exactly when she would be coming, he’d have to roll surprise too, and get a +6 to the surprise test.
## Initiative
Miss Muffet passed the surprise test and noticed that strange Honda Spirit in her rear sensor just in time. So she doesn’t take a -10 or any penalties thanks to passing the surprise test.
Since both characters are in hot sim they get to roll 4 dice to add to their 8 IS. Initiative Score is calculated from Data Processing + Intuition + 4d6 for hotsim. In this case they both have 5 DP + 3 int + 4d6. (SR5 p230)
  - Miss Muffet has an IS of 23.
  - Spider has an IS of 28.
  
### Pass 1
Spider wins the initiative. He doesn’t know that Miss Muffet has noticed him, so he thinks he has time to set up this attack. He uses his Free Action to do the Change Linked Device Mode (SR5 p163 & p202) to switch on his smart link to get a +2 dice for shooting.
He spends a Simple Action to use his Active Targeting to lock on to Miss Muffet’s sedan. (SR5 p184)
Spider makes a sensor test rolling 6 Perception + 3 intuition + 1 Hotsim Bonus (SR5 266, this might be a typo, but we’ll play it RAW for right now) +2 Control Rig (SR5 p452) [7 Sensor]. So he’s rolling 12 dice, and gets 4 hits. (I’m not sure if we should take range into account. I think we should, but I’m not sure what the ranges for sensors is. So we ignore that for now.)
Miss Muffet, being aware of Spider, since she passed her surprise test can defend with 6 Sneaking + 7 Reaction +1 hotsim + 2 control rig [4 handling + 2 control rig]. Miss Muffet is rolling more dice at 16 dice, but has a slightly lower limit, which in this case isn't a big deal, but could be a problem later. Miss Muffet gets 7 hits, and loses 1 hit to her limit of 6.
Miss Muffet spotting Spider’s sensors beginning to target her, she pulls sharply in front of another car breaking Spider’s lock on.
Spider is not sure if Miss Muffet has spotted her or if she just normally drives like an asshole. Either way he can’t get a clear lock on Miss Muffet.
He uses his last simple action to take aim. This will give his next action, a gunnery action in IP2, a +1 dice, +1 limit, and allows him to ignore range modifiers all for just having a smartgun.
Spider loses 10 IS for his action. And is at 18 IS.
Miss Muffets turn. She knows there is something not right about the Honda Spirit following behind her with a conspicuous weapon mount, so attempts to do a Break Away Action (SR5 p204). This is a complex action. 7 Reaction + 6 Ground Craft + 1 hotsim + 2 control rig [3 speed + 2 control rig]. She needs to beat the 2 terrain threshold - 2 control rig, to minimum of 1. She ends up getting 2 hits, beating the threshold by 1 and moves up a category range to extreme.
So as Miss Muffet attempts to speed up and pull away, she unfortunately is being blocked off by traffic. She sees a small opening and takes it, plowing through the traffic to get away from Spider.
Miss Muffet also spends her free action to switch on her Ares Alpha’s smart link.
Miss Muffet is at 13 IS.
### Pass 2
Spider is sure Miss Muffet has noticed him. She’s at extreme range in an speed environment, which will place her at 151-300 meters away from Spider. This isn't a problem since Spider’s Crockett’s range would be at medium (SR5 p185), and with his take aim action last IP it allows him to ignore that.
He spends his Free Action to make a Called Shot to Miss Muffet’s tire followed by a complex action to fire his mounted Crockett. He rolls 7 Logic + 6 Gunnery (SR5 p183) + 2 smart link + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig + 1 aim - 4 call shot [6(8)+1(aim) accuracy]. And he gets 8 hits.
Miss Muffet uses her Free Action to engage Evasive Driving (SR5 205) and takes a -10 to her IS bringing her to 3 IS. Evasive driving adds her intuition to the dodge test. Miss Muffet rolls 7 Rea + 3 int +1 hot sim + 2 control rig + 3 int (from evasive driving) +2 for partial cover from random traffic. From some miracle of science she gets 10 hits. Because no skill was used in this test, there is no limit.
Miss Muffet swerves out of the way of the bullet. And Spider whispers under his breath, ‘Bulldrek.’
Spider loses 10 IS and is at 8 IS now.
Miss Muffet’s turn. This will be her last action this IP. She’s been driving like crazy, but needs to keep an eye on the road and not on Spider. So she makes a control vehicle test (SR5 p203) to make sure she doesn’t lose control. She rolls 7 Rea + 6 ground craft + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig [3 speed + 2 control rig] vs threshold 1. She gets 6 hits and loses 1 to her limits, but has no problems keeping control.
Miss Muffet is at -7 IS and has no IP’s left this turn.
### Pass 3
Spider also has to make sure he doesn’t lose control either. Makes the same control vehicle test and gets 3 hits. More then enough to keep going.
He spends his free action to switch his Crockett in to burst fire mode.
He’s at -2 IS, which means this is the end of the first combat turn.
## Turn 2

## Roll Init
  - Miss Muffet – 28 IS
  - Spider – 21 IS
  
### Pass 1
Miss Muffet goes first. She knows she needs to get away, but decides to watch the road first. So she does her control vehicle action now, to make sure in the next 2 passes she won’t have to worry about it. She gets 5 hits.
She’s at 18 IS.
Spiders turn. He doesn’t want to lose her and keep her in firing distance, so he does a catch up action. He rolls 7 rea + 6 ground craft + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig [4 speed + 2 control rig]. (SR5 204) He gets 3 hits. Since its 2 over the environment threshold it means he can move up 2 ranges in chase distances. So he goes from extreme to medium range. Between 11-50 meters away from Miss Muffet.
He is now at 11 IS.
### Pass 2
Miss Muffet needs to get off the highway. She realizes that the Honda Spirit will be able to drive circles around her in a speed environment. But before she commits to anything too stupid, decides to take some pop shots at Spider to hopefully slow him down a bit.
She spends a free action to put her Ares Alpha in to Full auto.
Then a complex action to fire at Spider’s Spirit. She goes for a complex Full Auto Fire, which will give her recoil of 10. Luckily, the Ford Americar has body of 11 and drones/vehicles get recoil compensation equal to their body. (SR5 176) She rolls 7 logic + 6 gunnery + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig + 2 smart link - 1 for being at medium range [5(7) accuracy] She gets 4 hits.
Spider tries to dodge. Rolling 7 Rea + 3 Int + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig -9 from the spray of bullets coming at him. That’s 4 dice. Spider thinks now might be a good time to also take some Evasive Driving actions. He loses his next free action and take -10 to his IS, leaving him with 1 IS. He adds 3 int to his dodge dice. So he is now rolling 7 dice. And get 1 hit. He really doesn’t feel like being shot, so spends 1 edge point to reroll the failed dice. He gets 3 more hits. And is just barrel able to keep out of Miss Muffet’s fire.
Spider is really rethinking his choice about getting this close. If he had another action, he might try to take cover behind a semi or open fire with a complex burst. But he doesn’t. So he now has to spend this IP controlling his vehicle. He gets 7 hits but runs into his speed limit of 6, so loses a hit.
He is at -9 IS, and can no longer act.
### Pass 3
Miss Muffet decides to do a stunt action. (SR5 p204) She makes a sharp turn and hits an off ramp to get on to 148th Ave. She knows she’ll have better luck in the narrow streets where the maneuverability of her Ford Americar can out turn the Honda Spirit.
We’re going to increase the threshold for this stunt. Its going to be hard, since it’ll be a really sharp turn, So a 3 threshold. Then we add +1 light Terrain. (SR5 p200 & 201). So the new threshold is going to be 4. Lucky for our riggers with their rating 2 control rig, it reduces the threshold by its ratings. So they only need to make a threshold 2 test.
Miss Muffet rolls. 6 ground craft + 7 reaction + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig [3 speed + 2 control rig]. Its still a speed environment, though if Miss Muffet succeeds at this, she’ll be an a handling environment and have a limit advantage over Spider. She gets 9 hits, which 4 of those hits go to waste.
Spider immediately has to do this test as well, or lose Miss Muffet. He rolls and gets 7 hits, and loses 1 hit to his limit of 6.
## Turn 3

## Init Roll
  - Miss Muffet – 24
  - Spider – 18
  
### Pass 1
Both Miss Muffet and Spider made it on to the off ramp. Its a threshold 2 average difficulty, being a narrow spot + 1 for a thoroughfare. This won’t be a big deal to our riggers because the reduce it to a threshold 1 test.
Miss Muffet takes her control vehicle action now. And gets 5 hits.
Spider does the same. Gets 3 hits.
Miss Muffet – 14
Spider – 8
### Pass 2
Miss Muffet opens fire again. 7 logic + 6 gunnery + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig + 2 smart link - 1 medium range [5(7) accuracy] 6 hits.
Spider wastes his next turn on evasive driving. 7 Rea + 3 Int + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig -9 from full auto fire + 3 int from evasive driving. He gets 3 hits. Spider decides to push the limit and use another edge. He rolls his 3 edge dice and gets 1 six. He rolls that 6 again and gets a 4. He got a total of 4 hits.
Miss Muffet’s Ares Alpha has a Damage Value (DV) of 11. Add the 2 net hits, and Spider needs to soak 13 DV.
Spider soaks with Body 8 + Armor 6 - 2 AP from the Alpha. He only gets 3 hits. His car takes 10 damage. It has 16 boxes of physical condition monitor. (SR5 p199) The Spirit only has 6 boxes left. All driving tests are now taking a -3 to all actions as well.
Not only did Spider need to soak damage for his vehicle, but now he needs to soak biofeedback damage because he was in hot sim. Half of the 10p his car took is turned in to biofeedback damage (SR5 p266). So he needs to soak 5p with 3 Will + 6 Firewall. He gets 4 hits. So luckily only takes 1p. Not too bad considering how messed up his car just got.
Miss Muffet – 4 IS
Spider – -2 IS

### Pass 3
Miss Muffet thinks she can finish this off with one more shot. She spends a free action to switch the alpha to burst fire, so she doesn’t suffer too much recoil. She fires a 3 round burst.
The Alpha has 2 RC, and the Ford America as 11 RC. She’s already accumulated 10 recoil. With 3 round burst will put her over her RC by 1.
She rolls 7 log + 6 gunnery + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig + 2 smart link - 1 medium range - 1 recoil [5(7) accuracy]. She gets 5 hits.
Spider attempts to dodge. 7 reaction + 3 int + 3 int (evasive driving) +1 hot sim + 2 control rig - 2 from burst fire - 1 from dodging last pass. He gets 7 hits and is able to evade the shots.
## Turn 4

## Init Roll
  - Miss Muffet – 22
  - Spider – 22
  
Because this is a tie. And Miss Muffet and Spider have the exact same attributes, we flip a coin. Spider is going first.
### Pass 1
Spider’s not stupid. He realizes he’s in a bad spot. And he also realizes that he has an RFID tag on Miss Muffet’s Americar. He decides to cut his losses for now, and performs a stunt to do a U turn and run away to get his car repaired. This would be a Hair pin turn 3 + 1 for Main street thoroughfare -2 for control rig.
He rolls 7 Rea + 6 ground craft + 1 hot sim + 2 control rig - 3 damage. He gets 4 hits and is now driving in the opposite direction.
Miss Muffet has to match this stunt if she wants to follow him. But she thinks she’s made her point with her Alpha.
Combat ends.
Spider figures he’ll swing by his Mechanic contact to help repair his Honda Spirit and pick up some of his drones before going back after Miss Muffet.
Miss Muffet calls up her Street Doc and asks if he's got a Faraday Cage and a Tag Eraser.
